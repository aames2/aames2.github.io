            <b>I'd also like to Share:</b> My fiance and I rescued a german shepherd mutt (seen in my
            picture) who we sometimes refer to as “psycho” because he is ALWAYS ready to play and has an obsession with
            tennis balls, rubber balls, baseballs…any toy that’s a ball. The only thing going on in his head is elevator
            music and waiting to chase a ball.
