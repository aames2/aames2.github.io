        <h1>About Hailey</h1>
        <!--verify if this information is accurate or needs to be changed stylewise-->
        <section id="about-hailey">
            <p>I'm Hailey, a self-taught crochet artist who loves bringing warmth and joy into people's homes through my
                creations.</p>
            <p>I specialize in making decorative and functional crochet items, from cozy blankets to adorable amigurumi.
            </p>
            <p>My grandmother taught me to crochet when I was eight, and I've been hooked ever since! I started this
                business to share my passion with others.</p>
            <p>My mission is to create beautiful, high-quality items that can be cherished for years. I focus on
                sustainable materials whenever possible.</p>
            <p>Each piece I make is crafted with care and attention to detail. I believe the personal touch of
                handcrafted items creates a special connection with my customers.</p>
            <p>I'm active in our local arts community and donate a portion of all sales to the local animal shelter.</p>
            <p>For custom orders or questions, please reach out through the <a href="contact.html">contact form</a> on
                my website or email me directly at <a
