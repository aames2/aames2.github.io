                <a class="coke" href="https://us.coca-cola.com/">Coca-cola</a><br>
                <p>The coke website has nice contrast, everything is easily readible on top of the colors underneath.
                    Repititon is consistent throughout; fonts, colors, and shapes are all very similar as you scroll and
                    read. The alignments are all well-fitting and nothing sticks out or looks strange. Proximitiy
                    principles are correctly applied throughout the webpage and everything is easy to find. Related
                    elements are grouped nicely.</p>
                <a class="bella" href="http://bellads.info/">Bella De Soto</a>
                <p>This website goes painfully against every principle in the CRAP ideaology. It does not have good
                    contrast, it has repitition as in there is continuously so much "crap" everywhere, alignment is some
                    of the worst I've ever seen on a webpage, and proximity is out the window.</p>
