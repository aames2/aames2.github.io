            <p>Discover the joy of board games.</p>
            <p>Some games require skill, some require strategy, and some require luck. The game being pictured is a
                beautiful blend of each. In this game, players become powerful wizards battling to steal treasures, cast
                spells, and outwit others in the dungeon. Great for game nights, Wiz-War offers enjoyment for both
                seasoned gamers and newcomers.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>My friends and I are a group of board game enthusiasts who love to spend freetime playing games we enjoy
                and learning new ones. </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes it is hard to decide what game to play or buy, but there are lists on the
                internet with recommendations that I often follow for advice. Boardgamegeek is a personal favorite for
                helping decide whether or not I should play a game. Thousands of people put their reviews and ratings on
                this <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

            <h2>Game Nights</h2>
            <p>We typically play at someone's house on a chosen weeknight or at local board game shops in evenings. Many
                of these shops have schedules for pre-arranged events such as Dungeons & Dragons Wednesdays, Crisis
                Protcol Thursdays, Magic
                the Gathering Fridays, Board Games on weekends, etc.</p>
            <p>If you have interest but none of your friends want to try anything, don't be afraid to look for a public
                place where people meet and play. Many schools have clubs and many stores have designated nights where
                anyone can come join the fun.</p>

            <p>From cozy living rooms to spacious game shop play spaces, we play everywhere. Beer and pretzels are often
                a nice snack to enjoy while playing games and our favorite shop has many drinks and snacks to choose
                from.</p>
            <p>While we spend a lot of time playing in someone's living room or kitchen, there are plenty of other
                options out there. Just go online and search for local game shops or board game clubs.</p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>Just getting started or have been playing games for years, there's always a new game to learn. Many
                people who play and shops who sell, will sit down and explain to new players how to play games they are
                interested in, or recommend options for what they are looking for. All you have
                to do is ask.</p>
            <p>Depending on how complex you like your games to be, you can find instruction manuals that take minutes to
                read or up to hours to determe all the rules and engagements required for sufficient gameplay.</p>
            <p>Just like videogames and movies, many board games also gain expansions or remakes as years pass and
                popularity
                increases.</p>

            <h2>Why Play Board Games</h2>
            <p>Digital screens often dominate our attention, board games provide a way to connect without internet and
                brings people together for strategy, and laughter. Beyond being a fun way to spend
                an evening, board games challenge our minds, encourage strategic thinking, and supports social
                interaction
                and teamwork. Some are even based on creativity, where each game is a unique playthrough and different
                ending.</p>
            <p>Playing board games isn't just a pastime; it's a way to meet new people or connect with friends.
                Everybody loves winning, but sometimes crazy turns, or unexpected defeats are sufficient. It is also one
                of the few ways for face-to-face interaction nowadays.
            <p>Our group has been playing together for many years and we have created so many memorable moments. Board
                games also teach us some important real-life skills like patience, negotiation, and how to win or lose
                gracefully.</p>

                    connected with from board games or card games. Even at this party, we started the night with games.
                    This photo is from after our college graduations, showing that we have remained connected even after
                    college.
                    Many of these people went to different colleges and
                    live in
                    different places now but we remain friends and get together for games when we can.</figcaption>
