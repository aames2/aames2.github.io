            <h2>Why Play Board Games</h2>
            <p>Digital screens often dominate our attention, board games provide a way to connect without internet and
                brings people together for strategy, and laughter. Beyond being a fun way to spend
                an evening, board games challenge our minds, encourage strategic thinking, and supports social
                interaction
                and teamwork. Some are even based on creativity, where each game is a unique playthrough and different
                ending.</p>
            <p>Playing board games isn't just a pastime; it's a way to meet new people or connect with friends.
                Everybody loves winning, but sometimes crazy turns, or unexpected defeats are sufficient. It is also one
                of the few ways for face-to-face interaction nowadays.
            <p>Our group has been playing together for many years and we have created so many memorable moments. Board
                games also teach us some important real-life skills like patience, negotiation, and how to win or lose
                gracefully.</p>

                    connected with from board games or card games. Even at this party, we started the night with games.
                    This photo is from after our college graduations, showing that we have remained connected even after
                    college.
                    Many of these people went to different colleges and
                    live in
                    different places now but we remain friends and get together for games when we can.</figcaption>
